          <h1>What is Formula 1?</h1><br>
          <p>Formula 1 (also known as F1) is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater
            formula racing cars. F1 cars are highly engineered, open-cockpit, open-wheel single-seater cars designed
            specifically for racing. They are the fastest regulated racing cars in the world. The F1 season consists of
            a series of Grand Prix races held around the world on purpose-built circuits or public roads. There are
            typically 20-22 races each season. Ten teams, or constructors, field two drivers each for a total
            of 20 drivers per race.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            The top 10 finishing drivers get points on a scale ranging from 25 points for the
            winner to 1 point for 10th place and no points for drivers finishing between 11th to 20th. At the end of the
            year, the constructor with the most points wins the World’s Constructor Championship (WCC) and the driver
            with the most points wins the World’s Drivers Championship (WDC).</p>
          <p><br>
            Each race weekend is structured with practice sessions, qualifying, and the final race. Qualifying
            determines the starting grid order for the race. Races range in length from 190-310 km (118-193 miles) and
            last approx 1.5-2 hours. Strategy, pit stops, fuel/tire management are key parts of the competition. The
            cars rely heavily on aerodynamics and have hybrid engines producing around 1000hp. Iconic F1 teams include
            Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, Williams, Red Bull Racing. Top drivers are global superstars.
